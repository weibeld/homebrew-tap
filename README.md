# Homebrew tap

This is a [Homebrew tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) with custom Homebrew formulas.

## Usage

You can install any formula in this tap with:

```bash
brew install weibeld/tap/<formula>
```

The above command installs both the tap (`weibeld/tap`) and the formula (`<formula>`) in a single step.

Alternatively, you can install the tap and the formula separately:

```bash
brew tap weibeld/tap
```

And then:

```bash
brew install <formula>
```
